🧮 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using pandas.read_csv()

Displayed shape, columns, and first few rows

Checked for missing values and data types

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics using describe()

Visualized trends (sales by category, region, gender, etc.)

Identified outliers and anomalies

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values

Renamed columns and standardized data types

Removed irrelevant or inconsistent entries

4️⃣ SQL Integration (MySQL)

Created a MySQL database and imported cleaned data

Executed analytical queries, such as:

Top 5 products by sales

Average discount rate per category

Customer count by region

Total revenue by month

5️⃣ Dashboard (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to MySQL dataset

Built interactive visuals:

Sales overview and trends

Regional and gender-based performance

Discount vs revenue comparison

Added filters, slicers, and KPIs for easy exploration

6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Created a concise report summarizing insights

Designed a Gamma App Presentation for stakeholders

Highlighted key findings, business implications, and recommendations

💡 Future Improvements

Automate data refresh with Power BI Service

Add predictive analysis using Python (e.g., sales forecasting)

Integrate with APIs for live data updates
